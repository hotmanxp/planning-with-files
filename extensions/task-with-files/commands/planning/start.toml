Start a planning session for the task: {{args}}

STEP 1: Create task directory and initialize files
Run: !{node ${extensionPath}/commands/scripts/set-current-task.js {{args}}}

This will:
- Create the task directory: task_{{args}}_YYYY-MM-DD
- Copy templates (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md)
- Set current_task.json to track the active task

STEP 2: Read the task_plan.md template
Read the newly created task_plan.md file to understand the structure.

STEP 3: Customize task_plan.md
Edit the following sections:
1. Update "## Goal" with a clear one-sentence objective
2. Review the default phases and customize for this task
3. Add any key questions that need to be answered
4. Note any constraints or requirements

STEP 4: Create initial findings.md entry
Update findings.md with:
- User requirements from the request
- Any initial research or project analysis
- Technical decisions made during planning

STEP 5: Log the session start in progress.md
Add a session entry with:
- Current date
- Phase 1 status: in_progress
- Initial actions taken

Remember:
- Context Window = RAM (volatile, limited)
- Filesystem = Disk (persistent, unlimited)
- Anything important gets written to disk.

After setup, proceed with Phase 1 of the plan.
