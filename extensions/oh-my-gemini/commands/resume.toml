First, check the current task status:
```
!{ cat .agent_working_dir/current_task.json 2>/dev/null || echo '{"current": null}' }
```

If current is null or the file doesn't exist:
- Tell the user "No active task to resume. Would you like to start a new task with /omg:start [your-task-description]?"

Otherwise, resume the previously started planning task.

Use the **planning-with-files** skill to:
1. Check for active task and validate planning files exist
2. Load context from task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md
3. Restore context and continue from last session
4. Re-read the plan to understand current progress

Remember: Re-read the plan before major decisions. Update progress.md with session activity.
