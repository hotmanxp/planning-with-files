prompt = """
First, check the current task status:
```
!{ cat .agent_working_dir/current_task.json 2>/dev/null || echo '{"current": null}' }
```

If current is null:
- Tell the user "No active task to clear."

Otherwise, reset the current task tracking.

This command will:
1. Show the user what task is being abandoned
2. Read current_task.json from .agent_working_dir/
3. Set the "current" field to null
4. Confirm the reset to the user

Note: This does NOT delete the task files (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md). They remain for future reference.
