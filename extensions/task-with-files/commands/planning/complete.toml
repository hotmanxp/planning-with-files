Verify and complete the planning session.

STEP 1: Check task completion
Read task_plan.md and verify:
1. All phases marked as **Status:** complete
2. All checkboxes are checked (- [x])
3. No pending tasks remain

STEP 2: Verify documentation
Check that all files are complete:
1. task_plan.md - All phases done, decisions documented
2. findings.md - Research and decisions captured
3. progress.md - Session logs complete with test results

STEP 3: Generate completion report
If complete, create a summary including:
- Original goal
- What was accomplished (by phase)
- Key decisions made
- Deliverables created
- Files modified/created

If incomplete, list:
- Remaining phases
- Incomplete tasks
- Suggested next steps

STEP 4: Reset current_task.json (if complete)
Only if ALL phases are complete:
Run: !{node -e "const fs=require('fs'); fs.writeFileSync('${workspacePath}/.agent_working_dir/current_task.json', JSON.stringify({current: null}, null, 2));"}

This marks the task as complete and allows starting fresh.

STEP 5: Provide deliverables
Summarize what the user can now use:
- Code files created
- Documentation written
- Tests passing
- Any deployment instructions

Remember: Only mark complete if ALL work is truly done.
