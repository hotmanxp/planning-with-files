First, check the current task status:
```
!{ cat .agent_working_dir/current_task.json 2>/dev/null || echo '{"current": null}' }
```

If current is null:
- Tell the user "No active task to complete."

Otherwise, verify and complete the planning session.

Use the **planning-with-files** skill to:
1. Read task_plan.md and verify all phases are marked complete
2. Verify documentation (findings.md, progress.md) is complete
3. Run final verification: read changed files, run diagnostics
4. Generate completion report with deliverables
5. Reset current_task.json if all work is done

Only mark complete if ALL work is truly done. Be thorough - verify each phase.
