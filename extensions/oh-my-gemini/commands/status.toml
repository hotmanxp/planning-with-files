First, check the current task status:
```
!{ cat .agent_working_dir/current_task.json 2>/dev/null || echo '{"current": null}' }
```

If current is null or the file doesn't exist:
- Tell the user "No active task. Would you like to start a new task with /omg:start [your-task-description]?"

Otherwise, show the current planning progress at a glance.

Use the **planning-with-files** skill to:
1. Read task_plan.md from current task directory
2. Display task overview, phase status table, and next steps
3. Show recent activity from progress.md

Format as a visual status report with markdown tables and checkboxes.
