Resume a previously started planning task.

STEP 1: Check for active task
Run: !{node ${extensionPath}/commands/scripts/resume-task.js}

If TASK_RESUMED=true:
- A task directory was found
- Planning files exist
- You can proceed to resume

If TASK_RESUMED=false:
- No active task found
- Inform the user there's nothing to resume
- Suggest using /planning:start [task-name] to create a new task

STEP 2: Load context (if task found)
Read these files in order:
1. task_plan.md - Review goal, current phase, and remaining tasks
2. findings.md - Understand what was learned/discovered
3. progress.md - See what was done in previous sessions

STEP 3: Restore context
Summarize for the user:
- Current phase and status
- Goal of the task
- What was completed last session
- What needs to be done next

STEP 4: Resume work
Continue from where you left off:
- Complete any in_progress tasks
- Update phase status as needed
- Log new actions in progress.md

Remember:
- Re-read the plan before major decisions
- Update findings.md after every 2 view/read operations (2-Action Rule)
- Log all errors in task_plan.md
