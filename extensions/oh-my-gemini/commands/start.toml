First, check the current task status:
```
!{ cat .agent_working_dir/current_task.json 2>/dev/null || echo '{"current": null}' }
```

Otherwise, start a new task with the following description: {{args}}

Use the **planning-with-files** skill to:
1. Create task directory and initialize planning files
2. Customize task_plan.md with goal and phases
3. Document initial context in findings.md
4. Log session start in progress.md

Core principle: Context Window = RAM (volatile), Filesystem = Disk (persistent).
